            McIntyre Family Baking officially opened its doors on Main St in 1974, however, its true beginning started several years earlier. <br>
             Gertrude McIntyre - Gertie to anyone who knew what was good for them - had always loved to bake. Her pies were infamous in Stars Hollow and a coveted item at every holiday bake sale. <br>
              In the spring of  1970 she opened a stand in the farmers' market and sold out every Sunday leading up to McIntyre Family Baking's doors officially opening in 1974. With business booming and her sons getting older, Gertie and her husband Allan took the leap and turned Gertie's signature pie recipes into Stars Hollow's favourite bakery. <br>
               McIntyre Family Bakery has seen some changes over the last almost 50 years, growing and adapting as the world around us changes. One thing that won't ever change is Gertie's perfected pie recipes. <br>
                Ownership has passed from Gertie to her eldest son Steve and now onto his daughter Mandy - that's me! And while we have added menu items over the years the heart of our bakery is found in Grandma Gertie's pecan pie recipe.
